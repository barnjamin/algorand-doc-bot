title: Create a fungible token

# What are fungible tokens?
Fungible tokens, or FTs for short, are a type of asset split into multiple units that are fundamentally the same and interchangeable one-to-one with each other. Algos are fungible, but since they are also a utility token for the Algorand network, they are implemented differently from the types of fungible tokens we’ll talk about in this guide.

Loyalty programs that offer reward points that can be traded in for merchandise or services are considered fungible. Fiat currencies are fungible and can be represented on the blockchain as stablecoins (a token that maintains a steady value usually by having backed reserves or through some stabilization algorithms) or by direct issuance on the blockchain (central bank digital currencies). Tokenized shares in real estate, a company, or a fund are usually fungible too.

Tokenizing a fungible asset is an onramp to all the benefits of a blockchain ecosystem that we learned about in the first section of this getting started guide (security, trust, immutability, efficiency, low costs, composability).

# How to create fungible tokens
Fungible tokens, like NFTs, are implemented as Algorand Standard Assets (ASAs). Also like NFTs, you do not need to write smart contract code. You just need to specify a few parameters to identify it as an FT (e.g. total count is greater than 1) and attach metadata so that potential owners have the information they need to validate the integrity of the asset. The relevant code snippet in each of the SDKs is as follows:

=== "Python"
    ```python
    txn = AssetConfigTxn(sender=accounts[1]['pk'],
                         sp=params,
                         total=10000,			// Fungible tokens have totalIssuance greater than 1
                         default_frozen=False,
                         unit_name="ALICE",
                         asset_name="Alice's Coins@arc3",
                         manager="",
                         reserve="",
                         freeze="",
                         clawback="",
                         url="https://path/to/my/fungible/asset/metadata.json",
                         metadata_hash=json_metadata_hash,
                         decimals=2)			// Fungible tokens typically have decimals greater than 0
    ```

=== "JavaScript"
    ```javascript
    const creator = alice.addr;
    const defaultFrozen = false;    
    const unitName = "ALICE"; 
    const assetName = "Alice's Coins@arc3";
    const url = "https://path/to/my/fungible/asset/metadata.json";
    const managerAddr = undefined; 
    const reserveAddr = undefined;  
    const freezeAddr = undefined;
    const clawbackAddr = undefined;
    const total = 10000;               // Fungible tokens have totalIssuance greater than 1
    const decimals = 2;                 // Fungible tokens typically have decimals greater than 0
    const txn = algosdk.makeAssetCreateTxnWithSuggestedParamsFromObject({
        creator,
        total,
        decimals,
        assetName,
        unitName,
        assetURL: url,
        assetMetadataHash: metadata,
        defaultFrozen,
        freeze: freezeAddr,
        manager: managerAddr,
        clawback: clawbackAddr,
        reserve: reserveAddr,
        suggestedParams: params,});	
    ```

=== "Java"
    ```java
        String creator = aliceAccount.getAddress().toString();
        boolean defaultFrozen = false;
        String unitName = "ALICE";
        String assetName = "Alice's Coins@arc3";
        String url = "https://path/to/my/fungible/asset/metadata.json";
        Address manager = null;  
        Address reserve = null;
        Address freeze = null;
        Address clawback = null;      
        BigInteger assetTotal = BigInteger.valueOf(10000); // Fungible tokens have totalIssuance greater than 1
        Integer decimals = 2;                               // Fungible tokens typically have decimals greater than 0
        Transaction tx = Transaction.AssetCreateTransactionBuilder()
                .sender(creator)
                .assetTotal(assetTotal)
                .assetDecimals(decimals)
                .assetUnitName(unitName)
                .assetName(assetName)
                .url(url)
                .metadataHash(assetMetadataHash)
                .manager(manager)
                .reserve(reserve)
                .freeze(freeze)
                .defaultFrozen(defaultFrozen)
                .clawback(clawback)
                .suggestedParams(params)
                .build();		
    ```

=== "Go"
    ```go
    creator := account.Address.String()
	assetName := "Alice's Coins@arc3"
	unitName := "ALICE"
	assetURL := "https://path/to/my/fungible/asset/metadata.json"
	assetMetadataHash := metadataHash
	totalIssuance := uint64(10000)  // Fungible tokens have totalIssuance greater than 1
	decimals := uint32(2)           // Fungible tokens typically have decimals greater than 0
	manager := ""
	reserve := ""
	freeze := ""
	clawback := ""
	defaultFrozen := false
	note := []byte(nil)

    	txn, err := transaction.MakeAssetCreateTxn(
		creator, note, txParams, totalIssuance, decimals,
		defaultFrozen, manager, reserve, freeze, clawback,
		unitName, assetName, assetURL, assetMetadataHash)

    ```

Let’s imagine that Alice wants to create a loyalty point program for her buyers. She’ll represent these points as a fungible asset on Algorand and will call it AliceCoin. Owners of AliceCoin can use them to buy future artwork or trade it in for priority access to some of Alice’s art events. Let’s mint AliceCoin on TestNet. We will use the Algorand Foundation’s proposed [ARC-0003](https://github.com/algorandfoundation/ARCs/blob/main/ARCs/arc-0003.md) FT standard. 

Notice that we didn't set the [mutable asset parameters](https://developer.algorand.org/docs/get-details/asa/#mutable-asset-parameters) `manager`, `reserve`, `freeze`, and `clawback`. When you set them to `undefined` or an empty string, the protocol will interpret them as immutable from that point forward. That means you can't change these asset parameters anymore. You can find all asset parameters [here](https://developer.algorand.org/docs/get-details/asa/#asset-parameters)
